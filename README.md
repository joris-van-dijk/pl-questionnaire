# PL - Questionnaire

This repository  is the result of the  PL-trainer's insistence that he was looking for someone to 'digitize' a 
questionnaire. It allows users to fill in the questionnaire and to share the results with other people if so desired. 
It does this without any client-server communication, to make it deployable on Vercel.
